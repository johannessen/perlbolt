=head1 NAME

Neo4j::Bolt::Bytes - Representation of a Neo4j byte array

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Neo4j::Bolt byte arrays are a blessed reference to
 # a string, the bytes of which represent the array
 
 $string = $bytes->$*;
 
 $bytes = bless \$string, 'Neo4j::Bolt::Bytes';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Neo4j::Bolt::Bytes> instances are created by executing
a Cypher query that returns a Neo4j byte array value
from the Neo4j database.
They can also be created locally and passed to Neo4j as
query parameter. See L<Neo4j::Types::Generic/"ByteArray">.

Neo4j only has limited support for byte arrays. They shouldn't
be used for storing large blobs. Cypher doesn't provide a literal
syntax for creating byte array values. The only regular way to
create them in the database is to send them as a query parameter.
However, database plugin libraries may add functions able
to create them through Cypher statements without the use of
parameters. For example:

 # https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/5/overview/apoc.util/
 RETURN apoc.util.compress("data", {compression: "NONE"})

Before Neo4j::Bolt version 0.5000, byte arrays were returned
from the database as unblessed strings instead. Accessing
L<Neo4j::Bolt::Bytes> objects as strings is currently still
possible for backwards compatibility, but it issues a
deprecation warning and will likely be removed in a future
version.

This class conforms to the L<Neo4j::Types::ByteArray> API,
which offers an object-oriented interface to the underlying
byte string. This is entirely optional to use.
